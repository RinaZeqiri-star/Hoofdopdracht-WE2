									Growing up in Kosovo, I had the opportunity to participate in yearly school performances for November 28th, Albania's Independence Day. <br />

									We celebrated that occasion with shows as well. These performances featured traditional dances, music, and poems. <br />
									As a four-year-old, I was only entrusted with small poems, reciting them in front of parents, students, and teachers.

								<h2 class="slide-title">The move</h2>
								<p class="slide-text">
									When I moved to Belgium at the age of nine, I joined my cousin at the Albanian school she attended. <br />
									Every Saturday, we went together for language and dance lessons. <br />
									Having just arrived from Kosovo, my Albanian was strong, which meant I was often given the hardest poems or expected to know all the songs.

								<h2 class="slide-title">My strugels</h2>
								<p class="slide-text">
									However, I struggled with being the new kid and fitting in, even though I had my cousin by my side. <br />
									The biggest challenge was the language barrier. While we were there to learn Albanian, many of the kids spoke French, and I was learning Dutch at school. <br />
									Despite these difficulties, I always looked forward to dance practice each week.

								<h2 class="slide-title">Getting tired</h2>
								<p class="slide-text">
									Over the years, I memorized countless poems (which I eventually grew tired of) and learned songs from our music teacher. <br />
									But dance was what I loved most. Getting dressed in traditional costumes and performing new dances brought me so much joy. <br />
									One of my most embarrassing moments was forgetting a poem during a school show at the age of 13 because I hadn’t memorized it properly.

								<h2 class="slide-title">Growing up</h2>
								<p class="slide-text">
									By the age of 15, we grew tired of the same language lessons and started attending dance classes only, three times a week. <br />
									The intensity increased, and we began performing outside of school, like at a retirement home. <br />
									I was excited to finally perform in front of others besides our parents.

									As more people joined our group, I struggled with anxiety and felt out of place, except with my cousin. <br />
									Despite feeling alone at times, I continued because of my love for dance. <br />
									After a brief break, I decided to return, and I haven’t stopped since.

									Today, I’m one of the "older" dancers with the experience of many shows, including weddings. <br />
									Dance has been a significant part of my life, helping me through moments of sadness, anxiety, and growth. <br />
									I've become a confident dancer who cherishes every performance, embracing the joy it brings to both me and the audience.
